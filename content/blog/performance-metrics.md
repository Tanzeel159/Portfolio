ðŸ”— [Portfolio Website - Performance Metrics](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-portfolio-89m-pages-dev/vcdv7gyg23?form_factor=mobile)

In the fast-paced digital world, where attention spans are shorter than a cat video, how quickly your website loads can make or break the user experience. There has been extensive research done which highlghts the relationship between website performance and business success, why speed is one of the defining factors in how successful online ventures can be.

Some of the examples are highlighted below : 

- The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.
- DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.

These are some of the important topics I feel should be taken into consideration while designing a website:

1) **Significance of first impressions** : The loading speed of your website serves as a digital handshake, shaping the initial impression users form. So it's important to make a positive and lasting impact on the user.

2) **User Centric Philosophy** : Placing users at the centre of your website entails you are respecting their time . Web performance optimization embodies a commitment to enhancing the overall user journey through efficient, responsive design.

3) **Mobile Responsiveness** : With the prevalence of mobile devices, ensuring optimal web performance on these platforms is imperative. Failing to do so will massively impact user experience . 

4) **SEO Advantages** : There exists a symbiotic relationship between web performance and search engine optimization. Search engines reward fast-loading websites with enhanced visibility, making optimization a strategic component of digital marketing efforts.

Following are the metrics considered to measure website performance : 

1) **First byte** : How long the user sees a white screen for before anything can even start happening
2) **First contentful paint** : First bit of content loads
3) **Document complete time** : Generally when all of the static content has loaded
